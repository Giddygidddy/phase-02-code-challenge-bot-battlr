# Bot Battlr

Welcome to **Bot Battlr**, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom build your own Bot Army!

## Features

- Browse a list of available bots
- View a bot's details
- Enlist a bot into your army


Create a new project folder.
Create a new GitHub repository.
In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this dataLinks to an external site. for your server DB.
Run this command to get the backend started:
json-server --watch db.json

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:
http://localhost:8001/bots

As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.

- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should

  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.

  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.

- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the

  `YourBotArmy` component.

- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked

  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the

  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend
